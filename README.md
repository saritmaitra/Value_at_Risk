# Value at Risk (VaR)
Stock trading is rewarding and investing in stocks is an excellent way to grow wealth. However, the moment we open a position in the market, we are vulnerable to various types of risks, such as volatility risk. credit risk, market risk, operational risk etc. Thus it is extremely important for a trader to understand the risk factor and manage it effectively to preserve the trading capital as much as possible. In order to do so, we need to quantify to measure the risk using value at risk (VaR) statistical measures.
Using statistical method, we will develop an estimation of VaR where we shall predict the probability of maximum loss over a period of time.
